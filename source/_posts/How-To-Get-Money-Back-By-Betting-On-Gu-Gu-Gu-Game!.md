#  How To Get Money Back By Betting On Gu Gu Gu Game!

There is no doubt that casino games are the most thrilling option to have some leisure time. The excitement of anticipating whether the next card would be black or red, the possibility of doubling or even quadrupling your bet by taking a risk and the adrenalin rush when it all comes together- nothing quite beats it!

That is why many people are interested in learning about how to get money back by betting on gu gu gu game. 

This ancient Chinese game is believed to date back over 4,000 years and is still enjoyed by gamblers all over the world. To play this game, you will need three dice and a cup. After all the players have placed their bets, each player takes a turn throwing all three dice. If they roll a total of six, they must drink and pass the dice to the next player. If they roll any other number, they can either keep throwing or set the dice aside and pass to the next player. The player who throws all three dice and gets six again must drink again and so on until one player either runs out of drinks or has to give up because they cannot throw any more numbers.

The aim of the game is to score points by rolling certain combinations. The following are the scoring combinations:

One Pair: award 1 point
Two Pairs: award 2 points
Three of a Kind: award 3 points
Four of a Kind: award 4 points
Five of a Kind: award 5 points
Six of a Kind: award 6 points
One Pair with Sixes: award 10 points (this is called Gourd)


To win, you need to score more points than your opponents. The first player to reach 21 (or any other predetermined number) wins the game. If there is a tie, then the player with the highest single die value wins. 

There are various betting strategies that can be employed when playing GuGuGu game; let’s take a look at some of them below: 

      First basic strategy - Place your bet on any number between 1 and 6. This gives you a good chance of winning since 3 out of 6 possible outcomes will result in winners. So, if you bet on number 2 and your opponent bets on number 5, then you have 2 chances out of 3 to win (since 2 + 5 = 7 which falls in between 1-6). If your opponent bets on number 1 or 6 instead, then you only have 1 chance out of 3 to win (since 1 + 6 = 7). But remember, if you lose when betting on number 2 then you will lose double your bet amount! 

 Second basic strategy - Another way to increase your chances of winning is to place your bet on two different numbers i.e. 1 & 5 or 2 & 4. This gives you 4 chances out of 12 possible outcomes to win (since 1 + 5 = 6 / 2 + 4 = 6). So even if your opponent bets on number 3 or 7, you have still got 50% chance of winning! And if they happen to bet on numbers 1 or 6 again then you’ve won for sure! However, if both your chosen numbers come up as losers then you lose double your bet amount!

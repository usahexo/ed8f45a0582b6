#  NBA prospect Luka Doncic signs with Spanish club Joventut Badalona

Former Dallas Mavericks draft pick Luka Doncic has reportedly signed with Spanish second-division club Joventut Badalona.

The 18-year-old Slovenia native was the third overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft but was traded to the Atlanta Hawks on draft night before being sent to the Mavericks in a blockbuster trade involving six players and three teams.

Doncic played professionally in Spain for Real Madrid from 2015 to 2017, winning the Liga ACB championship in each of his two seasons. He also helped lead Slovenia to a gold medal at the 2017 EuroBasket tournament.

Joventut Badalona is a small club located in the city of Badalona, a northeastern suburb of Barcelona. The team competes in Spain's LEB Oro league, which is the second division of Spanish professional basketball.

The Joventut Badalona basketball team announced the signing of 6'8 forward Matt Thomas on Wednesday.

Thomas, who played his college ball at Iowa State, averaged 10.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per game last season.

"We are very excited to add Matt to our team," said Badalona head coach Jordi Vinyals. "He is a versatile player who can score in a variety of ways, and he will be a great asset to us both offensively and defensively."

Badalona, which finished last season in 11th place in the Liga ACB, is hoping that Thomas can help them improve on that record this year.

#  Barcelona beats Joventut Badalona in Liga ACB matchup

Joventut Badalona made a valiant effort to upset Barcelona in their Liga ACB matchup Sunday night, but the defending champions proved too much for the visitors. Barcelona was in control the entire game, leading by as many as 27 points in the second half en route to a 118-107 victory.

Badalona's Stefan Peno scored a game-high 36 points on 14-of-27 shooting, but it wasn't enough to overcome Barcelona's balanced scoring attack. Six different players scored in double figures for the home team, with center Ante Tomic leading the way with 20 points and nine rebounds.

The victory improves Barcelona's record to 11-1 on the season, while Badalona falls to 5-7. The reigning champions appear to be back in form after a sluggish start to the season, and they will look to carry this momentum into their Champions League showdown with Crvena Zvezda next week.

#  Joventut Badalona releases statement announcing intent to leave Liga ACB

On Monday, Joventut Badalona released a statement announcing their intent to leave Liga ACB. The team cited a lack of competitive opportunities as the motivation for their decision.

"After many years of complying with the regulations of the Liga ACB and after consulting with all the necessary entities, we have decided to leave this league due to the lack of competitive opportunities that our club faces," read the statement.

The decision by Joventut comes as a surprise, as they have been a staple in Liga ACB since its inception in 1987. In their statement, they cited the recent promotion of two teams - Alaves and Baskonia - to Liga ACB as the primary reason for their departure.

Joventut currently sits in 15th place in Liga ACB, with a record of 7-19.

#  Luka Doncic shines in final game for Joventut Badalona

In March of 2017, 19-year-old Luka Doncic signed a multi-year contract with Spanish basketball club Joventut Badalona. The Slovenian phenom had just completed his second season in the Liga ACB, Spain's top professional basketball league, and was considered one of the most promising young players in the world.

On Tuesday night, in Doncic's final game for Joventut Badalona, he put on a show. The 6'8" guard scored 25 points on 10-of-14 shooting, grabbed eight rebounds, and dished out five assists in a 107-99 victory over Iberostar Tenerife.

It was an emotional night for Doncic and his teammates, as they paid tribute to him following the game. "I'm very happy," said Doncic after the win. "It was my last game with Badalona and I'm really happy that we could win."

Doncic is expected to sign with Real Madrid this summer, where he will team up with fellow Slovenian superstar Goran Dragic. But don't expect him to rest on his laurels; at just 19 years old, Doncic has already proven himself to be one of the best players in the world.

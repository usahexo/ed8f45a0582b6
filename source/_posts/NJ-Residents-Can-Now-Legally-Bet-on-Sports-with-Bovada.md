#  NJ Residents Can Now Legally Bet on Sports with Bovada

When New Jersey residents want to bet on sports, their go-to site had been the Monmouth Park Racetrack. But starting May 14th, they are now able to place those bets with Bovada as well.

The state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement announced that Bovada is now licensed in New Jersey, joining FanDuel and DraftKings as one of the few legal offshore sports betting providers in the US.

Bovada is popular among US residents for its large selection of betting markets for both professional and collegiate sports. And in order to be licensed in New Jersey, Bovada has agreed to strict regulations, including geo-location tracking and daily reporting of all bets placed by New Jersey residents.

“We are excited to welcome Bovada to New Jersey and provide our players with another leading online gaming experience,” said Director David Rebuck. “This addition bolsters the number of regulated online gaming providers offering their products to New Jerseyans, which further enhances consumer protection and helps identify and prevent any potential unscrupulous activity.”

While there are other offshore sports betting sites available to Americans, only those registered with a state-approved licensing authority are allowed to offer services to New Jersey residents. This includes sites like Sportech Plc., William Hill US, and Unibet US.

How Bovada Sports Betting Works

Before we get into the specifics of how to bet on sports at Bovada, let’s take a quick look at how Bovada’s sportsbook works.

When you log in to your Bovada account, you’ll be taken to the home page, which looks something like this:

The main section of the home page is the betting lobby, which shows all of the current betting markets for the day. You can see the date and time at the top of the lobby, and below that are all of the different sports that are being offered for wagering. You can click on any of the sports listed to see all of the available betting markets for that sport.

To place a bet at Bovada, you first need to select a market. For example, let’s say you want to place a bet on tonight’s NBA game between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors.

Next, select “NBA” from the list of leagues:

























 _____5 At this point, you should have narrowed it down to one specific game. To view all available betting markets for that game, click on “View Lines”: You can now see all of the different types of bets that are available for tonight’s game. For example, you can bet on who will win outright or how many points will be scored in total. To place a bet, simply click on your desired wager amount and then click on either “Bet Now” or “Back This Wager” depending on whether you want to make a new bet or add this wager to an existing ticket: If you want to make additional bets on this game (or any other game), just repeat these steps until you have chosen all of your desired wagers: Once you have made all your selections, simply click on “Place Wagers” and your bet will be placed:    Tips for Placing Sports Bets at Bovada Now that we know how Bovada works, here are some tips for placing successful sports bets at this online bookmaker: 1) Start by picking games that you know about Before placing any bets, it's important to familiarize yourself with both teams involved in order to make informed decisions. Start by picking games where you have some knowledge about both teams - this will give you a better chance of predicting correct outcomes. 2) Shop around for good odds Not all betting markets offer equally good odds - it's important to compare odds between different bookmakers in order to find those that offer value . 3) Use hedging strategies Betting sites often offer reduced juice lines (or " vig ") when wagering on multiple outcomes simultaneously (known as hedging ). This means that it's possible to slightly reduce your overall losses (or increase your overall profits) by betting on multiple outcomes instead of just one . 4) Avoid chasing losses It's very easy - especially when starting out - to lose money while gambling . A good rule-of-thumb is not to chase losses by increasing your stakes in an effort to win back what was previously lost . This almost always leads to EVEN MORE losses in the long run . 5) Have fun! Gambling should be enjoyable above all else - remember not TOO focus too much on winning/losing , but rather enjoy watching your favorite team or players compete!

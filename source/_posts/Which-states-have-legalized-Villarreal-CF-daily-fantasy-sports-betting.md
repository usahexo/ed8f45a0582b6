#  Who is winning and losing when it comes to Villarreal CF daily fantasy sports betting?

Villarreal CF is a Spanish football club based in the city of Villarreal, Valencia. The team was founded in 1923 and currently competes in La Liga, holding home games at the Estadio de la Cerámica.



Villarreal CF is one of the most popular football clubs in Europe and their fans are spread out all over the world. The club has developed a sizable following in the United States, where daily fantasy sports are hugely popular. So it's no surprise that Villarreal CF is also a popular selection for daily fantasy sports betting.



The team has had mixed success so far this season. They are currently in 8th place in La Liga, but they have been on a bit of a roller coaster ride lately. They had an impressive 3-0 win against Real Madrid back in September, but then went on to lose 4 consecutive games. They have since recovered with 2 wins and a draw in their last 5 games. So who is winning and losing when it comes to Villarreal CF daily fantasy sports betting? Let's take a look.



When it comes to winning, we have to give the edge to those who selected Villarreal CF as their captain pick. The captain pick is the player that you select as your most important player for the day, and they earn you double points if they score or get an assist. With 8 goals and 3 assists so far this season, captain pick Pablo Fornals is certainly delivering good value for money.



Another player who has been performing well this season is substitute striker Gerard Moreno. Moreno came off the bench to score twice against Celta Vigo last weekend, taking his tally for the season to 7 goals in just 8 appearances. If you snagged him as your substitute striker then you would have also enjoyed some impressive returns.



However, not everything has been rosy for Villarreal CF this season. One big issue has been their defense, which has conceded 24 goals so far this campaign - more than any other team in La Liga's top 10. This means that anyone who selected Villarreal CF as their defensive pick will have likely lost money this season. Additionally, anyone who selected Santi Cazorla as their midfield pick will also likely have lost money - Cazorla has been out injured since October with an ankle injury.



So overall it seems like those who selected captain pick Pablo Fornals and substitute striker Gerard Moreno are winning when it comes to Villarreal CF daily fantasy sports betting this season. However, those who selected Santi Cazorla or any of the club's defensive players may not have had quite as much luck!

As with any other sport, there is some legal gray area when it comes to whether or not Villarreal CF daily fantasy sports betting is legal in your state. There are no federal laws that specifically address this issue, so it falls to the individual states to decide. In most cases, state law does not prohibit daily fantasy sports betting outright, but there may be specific regulations governing how it can be conducted.

For example, New York's Gaming Commission has issued a memo stating that paid contests that award prizes are considered games of skill and are therefore permissible under state law. Other states have taken a more restrictive stance, such as Arizona, which has deemed all fantasy sports contests to be illegal gambling schemes.

If you're not sure about the legality of Villarreal CF daily fantasy sports betting in your state, it's best to check with an attorney or your state gaming commission before placing any bets.

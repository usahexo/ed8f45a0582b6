 Neymar was the star of the show as Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 in a thrilling El Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.

#  Real Madrid stumble as Barcelona move closer to the La Liga title 

The last few weeks have seen Barcelona’s lead at the top of La Liga slowly diminish, as they have drawn twice and lost once in their last four games. This has allowed Real Madrid to close the gap, and they are now just one point behind their rivals.

Real Madrid were looking to capitalise on Barcelona’s recent wobble and take control of the title race, but they suffered a setback on Sunday night as they were beaten 2-1 by Valencia. This was a disappointing result for them, especially as they had taken the lead through Casemiro’s goal in the first half. However, they were eventually undone by two goals from Michy Batshuayi, and they will now need to pick themselves up for their Champions League clash with Ajax later this week.

Meanwhile, Barcelona bounced back from their recent setbacks with a 3-0 win over Eibar on Saturday afternoon. Lionel Messi was in fine form once again, scoring twice and setting up another goal for Philippe Coutinho. This victory means that Barcelona are now nine points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of the table, and they look well placed to win their 26th La Liga title.

As things stand, it looks like Barcelona are going to win La Liga this season, but Real Madrid will be determined to make a fight of it in the remaining games.

Barcelona 3-2 Real Madrid

There was no shortage of drama in the latest installment of El Clasico as Barcelona edged out rivals Real Madrid 3-2 in a thrilling encounter at the Camp Nou. Neymar was the hero for the hosts, netting twice, while Karim Benzema scored twice for Madrid.

The game started at a frantic pace and it was Madrid who took the lead after just six minutes. Some neat play down the right culminated in Gareth Bale crossing for Benzema to head home. Barcelona hit back soon afterwards as Neymar converted from the spot after being brought down by Dani Carvajal.

Both sides had chances to take the lead in an entertaining first half, but it was Neymar who struck again right on halftime. The Brazilian collected a pass from Andres Iniesta before firing past Keylor Navas to make it 2-1 going into the break.

Madrid started the second half brightly and were level within 10 minutes as Benzema headed home his second of the night from close range. However, Barcelona regained control of proceedings and sealed all three points courtesy of Neymar’s second goal of the night with 20 minutes remaining.

The result means that Barcelona remain top of La Liga, four points clear of Madrid who have now gone four league games without victory.

#  Barcelona come from behind to beat Real Madrid and stay on course for the La Liga title 

In a high-intensity El Clasico at the Nou Camp, Barcelona came from behind to beat Real Madrid 3-2 and stay on course for their 25th La Liga title. Luis Suarez opened the scoring for Barcelona in the first half, but goals from Karim Benzema and Casemiro turned the game around for Madrid in the second period. However, a late Lionel Messi penalty and then a winner from Philippe Coutinho secured all three points for Barca.

The result leaves Barcelona four points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of the table, with just seven games remaining. Real Madrid remain in third place, but are now 16 points behind their rivals from Catalunya. 

The tone for an enthralling contest was set early on, with both sides pressing high up the pitch and committing men forward. It resulted in some end-to-end action, but neither goalkeeper was really tested in the opening stages. 

It was therefore no surprise when Suarez broke the deadlock in the 29th minute. The Uruguayan raced onto a through ball from Sergi Roberto before firing past Keylor Navas into the bottom corner. 

Real Madrid began to get back into the game after going behind and they were level 10 minutes into the second half. Benzema finished well after being played through by Luka Modric, beating Marc-Andre ter Stegen with a low shot into the corner. 

Just two minutes later, it was 2-1 to Madrid as Casemiro headed home from a James Rodriguez corner. The hosts appeared to be heading for defeat, but they mounted a late fightback to earn all three points. 

First Messi converted from the spot after he was fouled by Marcelo inside the area, before Coutinho completed victory in stoppage time with a low strike following good work by Ivan Rakitic. 

The result means that Barcelona are still on course for an historic treble this season, with them also in contention for Champions League and Copa del Rey glory.

#  Heroic Lionel Messi leads Barcelona to victory over Real Madrid in El Clasico

The stage was set for an epic match as Barcelona took on Real Madrid in the latest installment of El Clasico. The stakes were high as the two Spanish giants battled for possession at the Camp Nou.

Lionel Messi was in inspired form early on, firing a warning shot at Keylor Navas' goal in the first few minutes. However, it was Real Madrid who took the lead in the 24th minute, with Cristiano Ronaldo slotting home from close range.

Barcelona didn't let their heads drop though, and they equalized just before halftime through a thunderous volley from Gerard Pique.

In the second half, Messi took control of the game. He led Barcelona's attack with purpose and drove them forward to victory. In the 72nd minute he finally got his reward, scoring a sensational solo goal to make it 2-1 to Barcelona.

The Camp Nou erupted with joy as Messi wheeled away in celebration, knowing that he had just won El Clasico for his team. Barcelona held on for the remainder of the match to seal an impressive 2-1 win over their rivals.

This win will give Barcelona a boost in confidence as they look to win La Liga this season. Meanwhile, Real Madrid will need to pick themselves up and dust themselves off after this disappointing defeat.

#  Premier League!

The Premier League is a professional English association football league. At the top of the English football league system, it is the primary men's football competition in England. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL).

The Premier League is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches (playing each other twice, once at home and once away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, others during weekday evenings. It is one of the most watched sports in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.

The Premier League was founded on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League Second Division to break away from the Football LeagueFirst Division and set up their own league. The new league had 22 clubs (Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest Olympic de Marseille (a club taken over by Nottingham Forest), Norwich City, Queens Park Rangers Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur) and was organised into four divisions: the Football League First Division became the Premier League; teams were relegated from the Premier League to the Football League Championship; teams were promoted from the Football League First Division to the Premier League; and teams were relegated from the Football League Championship to the Football League First Division.

On 8 November 2018 Richard Scudamore announced he was standing down as Chief Executive of the Premier League after 19 years in post. He will leave his role at some point during 2019 after all 20 Premier League clubs have appointed his successor

#  Alvin Gentry finds the right song and Pelicans start winning

There was a time not long ago when the New Orleans Pelicans were one of the worst teams in the NBA. Alvin Gentry, who was brought in as the head coach to turn things around, was struggling to find the right song that would get his team going. But then, a turning point.

The Pelicans started winning. And it's not a coincidence.

Gentry has found the right song that gets his team going: "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor.

"I've always been a fan of that song," Gentry said. "And I think it really gets us fired up."

Indeed, the evidence supports this claim. Since starting to play "Eye of the Tiger" before their games, the Pelicans have gone 8-3.

"It just gives us that extra boost of energy," said Anthony Davis, who has been one of the beneficiaries of Gentry's change in strategy. "We're all pumped up and ready to go."

Of course, correlation does not imply causation, and it's possible that the Pelicans would have started winning even without playing "Eye of the Tiger". But there's no doubt that this song has been a big help to Gentry and his team.

#  Who sings in the Tulalip casino jingle? Pelicans found their new anthem singer!

The Tulalip casino has been a Seattle institution for quite some time. The casino has always had a jingle, but the singer of that jingle has changed over the years. Recently, the Tulalip casino announced that they have found their new anthem singer in the form of pelicans!

The pelicans will be singing the Tulalip casino jingle in both English and Salish. The Tulalip tribe is very excited to have the pelicans represent their casino and believes that their unique rendition of the song will really appeal to guests.

Some people may be wondering why the Tulalip tribe decided to go with pelicans as their new anthem singers. There are a few reasons for this. First of all, pelicans are native to Washington state and are therefore a representation of the local community. Additionally, pelicans are known for being very playful and charismatic animals, which is something that the Tulalip tribe wants to convey with their casino.

The Tulalip tribe is hoping that by having pelicans as their new anthem singers, they will be able to further engage the local community and attract more guests to their casino. So far, it seems like this strategy is working as people have been sharing videos of the pelicans singing online. If you haven’t had a chance to see them yet, be sure to check out some of the videos online!

#  Pelican players take turns singing Tulalip casino jingle in locker room

When the Seattle Seahawks made the trip to play the Washington Redskins in Week 9 of the 2017 NFL season, they had a new tune to belt out in the locker room. According to players on the team, every time someone would score a touchdown or make a big play, they would take turns singing the jingle for Tulalip casino.

"It was all just in good fun," said wide receiver Doug Baldwin. "We were just trying to keep things light and have some fun."

The tradition started before the game, when players were getting dressed and warming up. Defensive end Frank Clark started humming the tune, and then everyone else joined in. Eventually, someone came up with the idea to take turns singing it in the locker room.

"It was pretty funny," said linebacker Bobby Wagner. "Some of us can't sing very well, but we still tried our best."

Interestingly enough, Tulalip casino is actually located about an hour north of Seattle, near where the Redskins play their home games. So it's not too surprising that players on both teams would be familiar with the jingle.

In fact, many people were surprised when Tulalip casino announced their sponsorship of the Seahawks a few years ago. But since then, both sides have seemed to benefit from the partnership. The casino gets some great exposure during Seahawks games, while the team gets some financial backing for their charitable work in the community.

"We're really proud to be partnered with Tulalip casino," said Seahawks president Peter McLoughlin. "They've been great supporters of our team and our community."

It's unclear whether or not the singing tradition will continue now that Seattle has moved on from playing Washington in the regular season. But if they do happen to meet again down the road, you can bet that there will be more singing in store for fans of both teams.

#  Anthony Davis leads New Orleans Pelicans in Tulalip casino jingle

Anthony Davis has been leading the New Orleans Pelicans to new casino heights this season. The third-year player is averaging 24 points and 10 rebounds per game, both career highs. Davis’s dominance was on full display Wednesday night when he scored 41 points and grabbed 14 rebounds in a victory over the Washington Wizards.

The 21-year-old phenom has become one of the NBA’s top players and most exciting players to watch. He is also one of its hardest working players, as evidenced by him recording a triple-double in just 22 minutes against the Philadelphia 76ers last month.

Davis credits his work ethic to his upbringing. He was raised by a single mother in Chicago, and he often had to help out around the house. “She worked a lot, so I had to take care of my sister,” Davis said of his mother Terri. “I had to do everything around the house – laundry, make food, get her dressed – so that helped me out when I got older and had to take care of myself.”

Davis is also one of the league’s most charitable players. He has his own foundation, which aims to improve the lives of children in New Orleans and Chicago. Last year, he donated $1 million to victims of Hurricane Sandy.

It is clear that Davis has already made a significant impact on the NBA, and he is only getting started. With a young team led by Davis, the Pelicans look poised to make a run in the playoffs this year. Davis is sure to put on a show for fans at Tulalip casino with his explosive play and high-flying dunks. Make sure you don’t miss it!

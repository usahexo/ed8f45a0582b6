        <h1 id="What-is-Mad-Men"><a href="#What-is-Mad-Men" class="headerlink" title="What is Mad Men?"></a>What is Mad Men?</h1><p>Mad Men is an American period drama television series created by Matthew Weiner and produced by Lionsgate Television. The series premiered on July 19, 2007, on the cable network AMC. After seven seasons and 92 episodes, Mad Men’s final episode aired on May 17, 2015.</p>
<p>The series centers on the fictional Madison Avenue advertising agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, and its employees in the early 1960s. The show portrays the political, social and cultural upheavals of the era.</p>
<p>The series begins in March 1960 and ends in October 1970. Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is introduced in March 1960 as the senior partner at Sterling Cooper. He is also portrayed as a hard-drinking womanizer who is able to create successful ad campaigns for his clients using his own psychological insight into human nature.</p>
<p>Draper’s wife, Betty Draper Francis (January Jones), is a housewife who seems to be increasingly unfulfilled with her suburban life. Their daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka) lives with them and attends boarding school.</p>
<p>Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) is a talented copywriter who started at Sterling Cooper as Don Draper’s secretary. She eventually rises through the ranks to become a creative director. Roger Sterling (John Slattery) is Don Draper’s boss and a founding partner at Sterling Cooper. He is generally level-headed, but has a sharp wit and isn’t afraid to use it to get what he wants.</p>
<p>Lane Pryce (Jared Harris) is another partner at Sterling Cooper. He is British, precise and efficient, but also somewhat humorless. Joan Holloway Harris (Christina Hendricks) is head of the secretarial pool and later office manager at Sterling Cooper. She is ambitious and ruthless when it comes to advancing her career.</p>
<p>The show portrays various fictitious accounts handled by Sterling Cooper; these include hamburgers, cigarettes, cars, bourbon whiskey, deodorant and air travel.</p>

<li>Lobster bisque * Roasted rack of lamb with truffle oil * Grilled Wagyu beef tenderloin * Seared scallops with bacon * Braised oxtail * Grilled Plato fish with ginger soy sauce * Portuguese chicken with chorizo * Pumpkin risotto * Timorese green beans with coconut milk</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these dishes are quite expensive, but they are well worth the price tag. The lobster bisque, for example, is made with fresh Maine lobsters and served with a side of creamy mashed potatoes. The rack of lamb is roasted to perfection and served with a delicious mint sauce. And the Wagyu beef tenderloin is cooked rare and served with a rich bordelaise sauce.</p>

It has achieved critical acclaim, won awards and has a passionate following. Why is it so popular?</p>
<p>There are many reasons. The characters are rich and complex. The setting is fascinating and realistic. The writing is superb. But I believe the main reason is that Mad Men explores universal human themes in a way that is both entertaining and insightful.</p>
<p>The show examines the challenges faced by men and women in the workplace, the dynamics of relationships, the impact of social change, and the search for meaning in life. It does so with authenticity and intelligence, which makes it a captivating experience for viewers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Mad Men is about human nature. It reminds us that we are all flawed creatures who are constantly struggling to find our place in the world. And that makes for a very addictive TV show.</p>
